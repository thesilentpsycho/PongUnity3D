# PongUnity3D


This is a small ping pong game built using Unity3D Game Engine. It has two players. Each of them control the slider using pre-defined keys on the keyboard.

If the ball crosses the player's side boundary, the other player gets a +1 score.

Whoever scores 3 points first, wins the match.
